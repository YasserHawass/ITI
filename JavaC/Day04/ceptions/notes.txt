- Throwable & Exception hierarchy (264,274)
	use the snippet and talk about it's types, like Error and Exceptions
	types of Exceptions too.
- (try and catch) block (j1.java) (j2.java)
	if error occurs it get wrapped and send to the catch block!
		// in case of using try only, compile prompts
		// error: 'try' without 'catch', 'finally' or resource declarations
- unhandled exceptions impact (jx.java)
- How to throw an Exception?

- Tips & Tricks
