# Selenium & hidden items.text
an odd behavior comes whenever try to .text an element hidden by code, or it's just not 
visible through windows (in case it's low res) xD


# SOME TRICK with Talend
the language might be arabic so  the numbers for excel files would render as arabic, and the rest
as english, and will then be Strings rather than integers

check the columns types PLEASE
